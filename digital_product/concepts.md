# Key Concepts

### Failure Mode and Effects Analysis ~ FMEA

Systematic, proactive method for evaluating a process to identify where and how it might fail and to assess the relative impact of different failures, in order to identify the parts of the process that are most in need of change. FMEA includes the identification of potential failure modes in a system, classification of the severity of the effects of failures, and listing of possible causes of failures, along with the likelihood of the failures occurring.

### Test Plan

Detailed document that outlines the strategy, resources, scope, and schedule of intended test activities. It is a roadmap devised by project managers, test managers, or testing teams to guide the testing process of a software project. The test plan is critical for ensuring that the newly developed or modified software system meets its requirements and works as expected in the real-world scenario.
