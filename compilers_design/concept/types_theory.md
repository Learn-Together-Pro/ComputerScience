## **Type Analysis** > Type Checking / Type Inference

Processes that ensure type correctness and deduce missing type information in programming.

**Type Checking** verifies adherence to type rules, catching errors at compile time, while **Type Inference** deduces missing type information, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

## **Typing Strength** > Strongly Typed Languages / Weakly Typed Languages

The strictness of type enforcement in programming languages affects error detection and conversion behavior.

**Strongly Typed Languages** enforce strict type rules, preventing implicit conversions and catching errors early, whereas **Weakly Typed Languages** allow implicit conversions, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.

## **Typing Explicitness** > Implicit Typing / Explicit Typing

The level of type inference required in programming languages determines the explicitness of type declarations.

**Implicit Typing** relies on type inference to deduce types without explicit declarations, while **Explicit Typing** requires programmers to declare types explicitly, reducing reliance on inference.

## **Typing Timing** > Dynamic Language / Static Typed Language

The timing of type checking in programming languages influences flexibility and error detection.

**Dynamic Languages** perform type checking at runtime, offering flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors, whereas **Static Typed Languages** perform type checking at compile time, ensuring type safety before execution.
