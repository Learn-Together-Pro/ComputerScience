# Some git misconceptions

#### ~~Branch of a tree is a good conceptualization of git branch~~

Not at all. Git branches get merged into the trunk( master branch ). That's not a tree at all. It's a rather directed acyclic graph ( DAG ). Also, it's not very useful to think that branches have commits, [branch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcaeZHmMjUI) is moving tag rather.

#### ~~It's better to use official documentation on git~~

Official documentation on git is rather poor and difficult to understand.
